# Bigrats for Linux

The official site of Bigrats is [flvcd.com](http://www.flvcd.com), which only provides Windows version.

This project is the Linux version of Bigrats video downloader written in [**Golang**](https://golang.org/) with GUI by deploying [GoQt](https://github.com/visualfc/goqt), and uses [avidemux](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux) to merge video segments. It will support Mac OSX very soon. This project has nothing to do with flvcd.com.

## Usage

The installation and configuration of bigrats go is a bit complex comparing with the Windows version. But as long as you have the basic knowlege of Linux, you can set it up by referring to [wiki page](https://github.com/dreamrover/bigrats-go/wiki). Let's get started!
